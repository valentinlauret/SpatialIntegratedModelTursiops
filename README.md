# Spatial Integrated Model Tursiops

Codes and data to run integrated spatial model for bottlenose dolphins in the NW Mediterranean Sea.
This repository contains all codes and data to run all models present in [our manuscript](https://zslpublications.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/acv.12815). Please contact me if something goes wrong with the code, or for any question.

# Data exploration

In [this file](Appendix1.pdf), we described the context of bottlenose dolphin _(Tursiops truncatus)_ monitoring in the French Mediterranean Sea. We provided a regional map of the study area, and a map of the monitoring programs used in this analyze. Then, we briefly displayed results of the comparison between models. You can [download all data and codes jointly](DataS1.zip).

# DS model 

  * [Data and codes](DS/) to run the DS analyze from aerial line-transects
  
# SCR model 

  * [Data and codes](SCR/) to run the SCR analyze from at-sea photo-identification
  
# Integrated Model 

  * [Data and codes](IM/) to run the IM analyze combining aerial and at-sea datasets
