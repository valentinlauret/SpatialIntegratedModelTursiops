# Data exploration

In [this file](DataAndResults.pdf), we described the context of bottlenose dolphin _(Tursiops truncatus)_ monitoring in the French Mediterranean Sea. We provided a regional map of the study area, and a map of the monitoring programs used in this analyze. Then, we briefly displayed results of the comparison between models.

# SCR model 

  * [Data and codes](SCR/) to run the SCR analyze from at-sea photo-identification
  
# SIM model 

  * [Data and codes](SIM/) to run the SIM analyze combining aerial and at-sea datasets
