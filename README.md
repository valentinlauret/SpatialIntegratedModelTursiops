# Data exploration

In [this file](Appendix1.pdf), we described the context of bottlenose dolphin _(Tursiops truncatus)_ monitoring in the French Mediterranean Sea. We provided a regional map of the study area, and a map of the monitoring programs used in this analyze. Then, we briefly displayed results of the comparison between models. You can [download all data and codes jointly](DataS1.zip).
